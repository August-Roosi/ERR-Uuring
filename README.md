# ERR-Analysis
# Andreas NÃ¤rep, August Roosi, Mihkel Rump

The aim is to analyze ERR articles and discover trends. We looked at word usage and lengths of articles and titles over time. 

The repository contains a web scraper file, json files that the scraper collected and files that parse and analyze the gathered data.

To replicate the analasys all you have to do is run the code that creates the graphs. Alternatively you could use the scraper to specify what date range to scrape from ERR and use the gathered data to create your own analasys.
